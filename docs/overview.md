## Flowser tool

Alright, so Flow is pretty awesome, but where does Flowser fit into the picture ?

Flowser (abbreviated for _Flow Browser_) is a one of a kind development tool for the Flow blockchain. It lets you inspect the current state of any flow blockchain network (emulator, testnet, mainnet,..) and it also manages the [Flow emulator](https://docs.onflow.org/emulator/), without you even knowing it. 

Development of Flowser started (but not ended) during [Flow's FlipFest buildathlon](https://github.com/onflow/flip-fest/issues/2).

Check out our video presentations at FlipFest and Flow Office Hours bellow.
