# Quickstart

## 1. Install Flow CLI

Flowser uses Flow CLI for
starting [flow-emulator](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator), [fcl-dev-wallet](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet)
and other tools / APIs.

For installation instructions see https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/install.

## 2. Run Flowser

You can install and run Flowser with a single Flow CLI command:

```bash
flow flowser
```

If you run this command in existing Flow project, Flowser will open that project and start Flow tools automatically.

<video muted={true} autoPlay={true} loop={true} style={{ width: '100%' }}>
  <source src="automatic-project-start.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Otherwise, you will need to configure and start the project yourself.

## Other installation options

You can install Flowser either via direct download yourself or you can use Flow CLI to do that for you.
